### XeLateX document development environment

This is my development environment for writing my CV.  It could be used for other LaTeX type projects.

I'm using XeLateX, TeXLive installation.  I won't cover that process; it can be pretty involved and painful-- but it's possible and once done it's done.

##### features

- IDE within Atom.  Given the terminal addon, we start the watcher/compiler with `coffee maker.coffee`, then edit .tex files in root folder; the compiled PDFs will be found in /build folder.
