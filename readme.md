### XeLateX document development environment

This is my development environment for writing my CV.  It could be used for other LaTeX type projects.

I'm using XeLateX, TeXLive installation.  I won't cover that process; it can be pretty involved and painful-- but it's possible and once done it's done.

##### characteristics

Basically it's an IDE within Atom.  Given the terminal addon, we start the watcher/compiler with `coffee maker.coffee`, then edit .tex files in root folder. On every save, the compiled PDFs will be found in /build folder, and if the PDF is open in another Atom pane, this will be updated automatically by Atom.  Very smooth, very productivity-enhancing.
